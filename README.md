# Retro Game Engine v1.0
After having time 6 months off work in 2024/2025 due to breaking my back. I decided to learn C++ and at the same time code a Game engine.

After getting the basics of an engine up and running, the next and the hardest part was coding an editor. After Googling I found Dear ImGui, which seemed to fit the bill. 
This was yet another learning curb!

I am still trying to get my head around seperation of the game engine and the editor. By my way of thinking the editor should a stand alone application with the engine being a static library.
